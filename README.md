# Bike-Sales-Dashboard
Worked on an Power Bi project called "Bike Sales Trend Analysis" and created an interactive dashboard for it.
Middle-aged individuals are purchasing significantly more bikes than adolescents and seniors
A considerable percentage of people prefer using bikes for short-distance travel
North America leads in bike purchases compared to the Pacific and Europe
Males with higher average incomes are buying more bikes compared to females with slightly lower average incomes
Families with more than 2 children tend to opt for larger vehicles over bikes
